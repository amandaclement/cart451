OBSERVATIONS
library isn't very flexible: cannot easily add to or remove from the list of stopwords


certain negation terms not handled properly
i.e. "never" is considered to be a stopword which is problematic since "i am never happy" is filtered to "happy" and therefore gets a positive rating

NOTES/OBSERVATIONS
- n-stopwords library has more flexibility than stopwords library
    - i.e. can add/remove stopwords, check if a word is a stopword, display all stopwords in the list
- negation terms handled very poorly in this library
    - i.e. "not" is considered to be a stopword which is problematic since "i am not happy" is filtered to "happy" and therefore gets a positive rating

NOTES/OBSERVATIONS
- NaN represents neutral in these tests
- negation terms working as desired
    - i.e. single negations cancel next significant (tokenized) word, double negations cancel each other

- should not happy = unhappy? or inconclusive?
    - if not happy = inconclusive then passed all test cases

- the intensity of the extracted emotion isn't important for the visualization, unless it negates the meaning
    e.g. "happy", "very happy" and "extremely happy" -> happiness
    e.g. "barely happy", "rarely happy" -> inconclusive (to be barely happy is not a form of happiness)
    e.g. "not happy", "never happy" -> inconclusive (not happy doesn't necessarily mean sad or any other particular emotion, unless unhappy is considered to be an emotion of interest?)
    e.g. "not not happy" -> happiness (double negation so the "not"s cancel each other out)

    - 3 score positive (18.75%)
    - 5 score negative (31.25%)
    → 50% of expected neutral results are acceptable

- so, clearly, the expected neutral results that output a positive or negative score are the most problematic.

NOTES/OBSERVATIONS
- modification made: added a list of words that I consider to be more neutral than emotional when used in discussions surrounding COVID-19 (e.g. outbreak, disease, pandemic, virus, infect, alert, ill, spread, positive, negative) and removed these words from the sentiment score calculation
- results for expected positives and expected negatives are same as TEST 4 (as expected)
- improvements in correctness of expected neutrals:
    - Total # of expected neutral results is 16
        - 15 score neutral (93.75%)
        - 1 scores positive (6.25%)
        - 0 score negative (0%)
        → 93.75% of expected neutral results are acceptable
